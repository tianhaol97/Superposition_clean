# A Toy Model of Superposition — a statistical-physics view

*How can a neural network store more features than it has dimensions? By superposition — the same trick that lets packed spheres and frustrated spins settle into ordered compromises. This repo builds the smallest network that does it, reproduces the core results from scratch, and analyzes them with the tools of statistical mechanics: order parameters, phase transitions, and energy minimization. Runs on a laptop CPU in minutes.*

## 1. Why superposition matters

Modern language models almost certainly rely on superposition heavily — they represent far more concepts than they have neurons — which is a central obstacle for **interpretability** (the effort to understand what a network has actually learned): a single neuron ends up entangled in many unrelated concepts. A toy system small enough to solve completely is the right place to build intuition before facing real networks.

And superposition is, underneath, a problem statistical physics already owns. If you must place *n* feature directions in only *m < n* dimensions, they cannot all be perpendicular, so they interfere — and the network arranges them to minimize the total interference. That is a **frustration** problem, with century-old cousins:

- the **Thomson problem** — charges repelling on a sphere settle into regular shapes;
- **sphere packing** and **spin frustration** — many parts, each avoiding the others, settling into an ordered compromise.

With sparsity as a control knob, the natural question is the one at the heart of statistical mechanics: **does the system change phase as we turn the knob?** It does — sharply — and the ordered phases are regular polygons. This repo makes that framing explicit and quantitative: one order parameter swept across one control parameter, plus a direct measurement that the learned geometry minimizes a packing energy.

## 2. What superposition is

A network stores information in a fixed number of internal "slots" (axes of a coordinate system). Naively it can hold at most one feature per slot. **Superposition** is the trick of storing *many more* features than slots by laying them down as *overlapping* directions that share the slots. This works only because features are **sparse** — most are silent at any given moment, so the overlaps rarely collide. Below, the network discovers this on its own, and settles into exactly the shapes an energy-minimization argument predicts.

**A few terms, defined once:**

- **Feature**: one independent piece of information the network might represent (e.g. "the image contains a wheel"). We use *n* features.
- **Dimension / slot**: one axis of the network's internal storage space. We use *m* of them, with **m < n** — fewer slots than features. That scarcity is the whole point.
- **Sparsity**: the fraction of the time a feature is *off* (exactly zero). Sparsity 0 = every feature always on ("dense" world); sparsity near 1 = features almost never appear together ("sparse" world). This is our master control knob.
- **Superposition**: storing more features than dimensions by using overlapping, non-perpendicular directions.

## 3. Scope and relation to the original work

Everything here builds on **Elhage et al. (2022), *Toy Models of Superposition*** (Transformer Circuits Thread, https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html). The model, the feature-dimensionality metric, the quantized polytope geometry, and the phase-change picture all originate in that work. This repository is an independent reimplementation of its core, re-examined through a statistical-mechanics lens — deliberately narrow, not a full replication.

- **Reproduced from scratch** — the ReLU output model; the emergence of superposition with sparsity (*n* = 5, *m* = 2 → pentagon); the feature-dimensionality metric and its quantized values; a sparsity-driven phase diagram.
- **Added, extending the paper's own framing** — an explicit packing/frustration *energy* whose minimum the trained network attains exactly (a Thomson-problem reading of the geometry), and an order-parameter presentation of the transition with a derived scaling form (Section 5, Appendix).
- **Out of scope** — results in the paper not attempted here: the linear-model contrast, computation-in-superposition, correlated/anti-correlated features, higher-dimensional polytopes, learning dynamics, and the connection to real trained networks.

## 4. The model

The network is a deliberately minimal **autoencoder** (a network trained to copy its input to its output through a narrow bottleneck). It compresses $n$ features into $m  \lt  n$ dimensions and tries to reconstruct them:

```math
h = W x \in \mathbb{R}^{m}, \qquad \hat{x} = \mathrm{ReLU}\!\left(W^{\top} h + b\right) = \mathrm{ReLU}\!\left(W^{\top} W x + b\right). \quad (1)
```

Here $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is a single weight matrix, $b \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ a bias, and $\mathrm{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z)$ applied elementwise. **Column $i$ of $W$, written $W_i \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$, is the direction the network uses to store feature $i$** — its *representation vector*. The ReLU is what lets the network clip away the small interference from overlapping features.

**The data (the sparse world).** Each example $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ has independent features; feature $i$ is off with probability $S$ (the sparsity) and otherwise uniform on $[0,1)$:

```math
x_i = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{with probability } S, \\ u_i,\ \ u_i \sim \mathcal{U}[0,1) & \text{with probability } 1-S. \end{cases} \quad (2)
```

We call $p \equiv 1 - S$ the **density** (the probability a feature is on). The model never sees a fixed dataset — it learns the *statistics* of this world.

**The loss.** An importance-weighted mean squared reconstruction error, with optional per-feature importances $I_i$ (we use a geometric decay $I_i = r^{i-1}$, or $r=1$ for uniform), averaged over random inputs $x$:

```math
L = \mathbb{E}_{x}\left[\, \sum_{i=1}^{n} I_i \,\bigl(x_i - \hat{x}_i\bigr)^2 \right]. \quad (3)
```

## 5. Results

### Experiment 1 — superposition emerges as the world gets sparser

`python experiments/01_superposition_emergence.py`

We use the tiniest interesting model: **n = 5 features, m = 2 dimensions**, importance decay $r = 0.9$, so we can *draw* the storage space on a flat page. Each arrow is one feature's representation vector. The bars below show each feature's **dimensionality** $D_i$ (Elhage et al.) — how many of the $m$ dimensions feature $i$ effectively occupies, with $\hat{W}_i = W_i / \| W_i \|$:

```math
D_i = \frac{\| W_i \|^2}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} \bigl(\hat{W}_i \cdot W_j\bigr)^2}. \quad (4)
```

It runs from $D_i = 0$ (feature not represented) to $D_i = 1$ (feature owns a full dimension), and satisfies $\sum_i D_i \le m$ — there are only $m$ dimensions to share.

![Emergence of superposition](figures/01_superposition_emergence.png)

- **Dense world (sparsity 0):** the network can only afford **2** of the 5 features and stores them on **perpendicular axes** — no overlap, no superposition. The other three features are dropped.
- **As sparsity rises:** the network squeezes in more features. At intermediate sparsity it stores **4** features as two perpendicular pairs (a "plus" sign).
- **Sparse world (sparsity ≈ 0.97):** it stores **all 5** features as a perfect **regular pentagon**. The directions overlap, but since features rarely co-occur, the overlap rarely costs anything.

This is the canonical "Toy Models of Superposition" result, reproduced from scratch.

### Experiment 2 — the geometry is quantized, and it solves a packing problem

`python experiments/02_feature_geometry.py`

Staying with the $n = 5, m = 2$ model, we sweep sparsity finely and look at the *geometry* of the stored features. The two panels deliberately use different importances: **panel A uses a geometric decay ($r = 0.9$)**, which ranks the features so the dense-to-pentagon progression reads cleanly, while **panel B uses uniform importance ($r = 1$)**, the regime in which the plotted energy is *exactly* the quantity the loss minimizes (explained there).

![Feature geometry and packing](figures/02_feature_geometry.png)

**(A) Quantized geometry.** Recall the feature dimensionality $D_i$ from Eq (4). For $k$ unit vectors arranged as a **regular polygon** in 2D ($m=2$), every pairwise angle is a multiple of $2\pi/k$, so the denominator of $D_i$ collapses to a clean value (derived in the Appendix), giving

```math
D_i = \frac{2}{k}. \quad (5)
```

So the dimensionality does not drift smoothly — it **locks onto a discrete ladder** $2/k$, each value a specific shape:

| $D_i$ | $k$ | Shape the features form |
|---|---|---|
| $1$   | 1 | a feature alone on its own axis |
| $2/3$ | 3 | three features at 120° (a triangle) |
| $1/2$ | 4 | two features back-to-back (a pair) |
| $2/5$ | 5 | five features at 72° (a pentagon) |

In panel A, **each dot is one feature's $D_i$** (from the best of 6 seeds at that sparsity, not separate seeds); overlapping dots mean those features share the same dimensionality, as they do when the geometry is a regular polygon. The dots settle onto a discrete set of levels, and those flat plateaus separated by jumps are the signature of distinct **geometric phases** — like discrete energy levels in a physical system. (The $2/3$ line is drawn for reference; this particular model jumps past it.)

**(B) Training discovers the packing.** The paper identifies the model's *interference* term as a **generalized Thomson energy** — points packed on a sphere minimizing a repulsion. We make it concrete: the total squared overlap between *unit* feature directions,

```math
E(W) = \sum_{i \lt j} \bigl(\hat{W}_i \cdot \hat{W}_j\bigr)^2. \quad (6)
```

For $k$ unit vectors equally spaced on a circle this has the closed form $E_k = \tfrac{1}{4}k(k-2)$ (Appendix), so the regular pentagon sits at $E_5 = 3.75$. Panel B runs a single high-sparsity training at **uniform importance** — the regime where the loss's interference term is *exactly* this (generalized-Thomson) energy — and tracks $E(W)$ of the learned directions: as the reconstruction loss falls (right axis), the energy it is effectively minimizing is driven down and **settles onto the exact minimum $E_5 = 3.75$**. The network is never told to pack points on a sphere; it discovers the minimum-energy arrangement as a byproduct of reducing reconstruction error — the Thomson link, shown dynamically (and mirroring the paper's "energy-level" view of learning). How *non-uniform* importance reshapes this — which features get stored at all — is the subject of Experiment 4.

### Experiment 3 — a sparsity phase diagram

`python experiments/03_phase_diagram.py`

Now a bigger model (**n = 40 features, m = 10 dimensions**, importance decay $r = 0.95$). We pick an **order parameter** — a single number summarising the macroscopic state — and sweep the sparsity knob. Our order parameter is **features-per-dimension** $\phi$: the number of features actually stored (those with a non-negligible representation vector, $\| W_i \| \gt \tau$ with $\tau = 0.5$) divided by the number of dimensions $m$:

```math
\phi = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbf{1}\!\left[\, \| W_i \| \gt \tau \,\right]. \quad (7)
```

$\phi = 1$ means "no superposition" (each stored feature owns a dimension); $\phi \gt 1$ means superposition. The threshold $\tau$ is unambiguous because the learned norms are **bimodal** — stored features sit near $\| W_i \| \approx 1$, dropped ones near $0$ — so any $\tau$ in the gap (≈ 0.3–0.7) gives the same count; we use $\tau = 0.5$. (We also track **bottleneck usage** $\tfrac{1}{m}\sum_i D_i$, the fraction of representational capacity in use, plotted alongside it.)

Because a single run gives only a coarse integer count, we **average $\phi$ over 10 independent seeds** per sparsity (a disorder average) and plot the mean with its standard deviation, with sparsities spaced logarithmically in $1/\text{density}$ to resolve the sparse regime.

![Phase diagram](figures/03_phase_diagram.png)

The network sits in a **no-superposition phase** ($\phi \approx 1$) in the dense world, then crosses into a **superposition phase** as the world gets sparse, climbing toward the ceiling $n/m = 4$ where every dimension is shared among four features. This is structurally a magnet ordering as temperature drops: an order parameter responding to a control parameter.

A telling detail: **bottleneck usage stays pinned at 1 throughout** while $\phi$ climbs. The $m$ dimensions are *always* fully used; sparsity changes only *how many features share them*. The climb is gradual — the rarer features are, the more get packed in — and the most superposition lives in the sparsest regime. (The minimal version of this benefit-vs-interference competition, solved exactly in closed form, is **Experiment 4**.)

### Experiment 4 — the minimal model, with analytical results

`python experiments/04_phase_diagram_n2m1.py`

The smallest model that still has a phase change is $n=2$ features in $m=1$ dimension. It is simple enough to solve in closed form, reproducing the paper's "toy model of the toy model." The first feature has importance $I_1 = 1$ and the second ("extra") feature has relative importance $I_2 = I$; each is on with probability $p = 1-S$ at value $\sim\mathcal{U}[0,1)$. With $W=(w_1,w_2)$, $h=w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2$, and bias $b=0$, there are **three** natural ways to use the single dimension (the paper's three configurations):

- **not represented**, $W=(1,0)$ — keep feature 1, drop the extra: $\hat{x}_1=x_1$, $\hat{x}_2=0$;
- **dedicated**, $W=(0,1)$ — give the dimension to the extra, drop feature 1: $\hat{x}_2=x_2$, $\hat{x}_1=0$;
- **antipodal**, $W=(1,-1)$ — both in superposition: $\hat{x}_i=\mathrm{ReLU}(\pm h)$, exact *unless both fire*.

**Costs.** A *dropped* feature is best reconstructed by a constant — the model sets the bias to the feature's mean $\mathbb{E}[x]=p/2$ — so its cost is its **variance** $\mathrm{Var}(x)=\tfrac{p}{3}-\tfrac{p^2}{4}$ (not the raw second moment $\mathbb{E}[x^2]=p/3$; getting this right is what makes the boundary come out correctly). The *antipodal* pair reconstructs each feature exactly unless **both** fire (probability $p^2$); when they do, each feature's error is $\min(x_1,x_2)$ — the smaller of the two active values, each an independent draw from $\mathcal{U}[0,1)$ — and $\mathbb{E}[\min(x_1,x_2)^2]=\tfrac16$. Hence

```math
L_{\text{not}} = I\!\left(\tfrac{p}{3}-\tfrac{p^2}{4}\right), \qquad L_{\text{ded}} = \tfrac{p}{3}-\tfrac{p^2}{4}, \qquad L_{\text{anti}} = \frac{(1+I)\,p^2}{6}. \quad (8)
```

**Mechanism.** The interference cost is *exactly* quadratic in density (it is paid only on a collision, probability $p^2$), whereas the drop cost is the variance $\tfrac{p}{3}-\tfrac{p^2}{4}$, which is linear in $p$ **only at high sparsity**. So to leading order as $p\to0$:

```math
\underbrace{\text{drop cost} \;\sim\; p}_{\text{linear (small } p)} \quad\text{vs.}\quad \underbrace{\text{interference} \;=\; \tfrac{(1+I)\,p^2}{6}}_{\text{exactly quadratic}}. \quad (9)
```

So superposition wins once the world is sparse enough. The model takes the minimum of the three; equating $L_{\text{anti}}$ with the cheaper drop gives the superposition boundary

```math
\text{superpose} \iff p \;\lt\; p^\star, \qquad p^\star = \frac{4I}{2+5I}\ (I\le1), \quad \frac{4}{5+2I}\ (I\ge1). \quad (10)
```

These three phases tile the $(I,p)$ plane and meet at $(I,p)=(1,\tfrac47)$: **not represented** when the extra feature is unimportant and dense ($I\lt1$, $p\gt p^\star$); **dedicated** when it is the *more* important one and dense ($I\gt1$, $p\gt p^\star$); **superposition** whenever sparse ($p\lt p^\star$). The transition is **first order** (the optimal configuration switches discontinuously). The symmetric case is *not* "superposition for all sparsity": even at $I=1$ there is a genuine dense phase. Training the actual $n=2,m=1$ model confirms this three-phase map:

![n=2, m=1 phase diagram](figures/04_phase_diagram_n2m1.png)

Coloured cells are the trained model's phase across the $(I, p)$ plane; the solid curve is the analytic boundary $p^\star(I)$ and the dashed line ($I=1$) splits the two dense phases.

**The gap near the peak.** The trained superposition region sits slightly *above* the curve, with the largest gap around $I\approx1$ (where $p^\star$ is highest). This is not a structural error — it comes from two **simplifications in the closed form**, both in the *superposition* cost $L_{\text{anti}}=(1+I)p^2/6$:

- **zero output bias** — the trained model learns a *positive* bias that grows with density (we measured it climbing from $+0.07$ to $+0.31$ as $p:0.45\to0.68$), lifting the both-active reconstruction that the antipodal solution otherwise systematically under-shoots;
- **unit, fixed weights** — the trained model *shrinks* $\| W_i \|$ as density rises (we measured $0.98\to0.77$), attenuating the interference term.

Together these put the true superposition loss roughly $2.5\times$ below the $b=0$ estimate at the boundary. (The *drop* costs, by contrast, are exact — a dropped feature is optimally predicted by its mean.) Both tricks only pay off when collisions are frequent, i.e. at high density, so they buy almost nothing at the sparse wings — where the curve hugs the cells — and the most near $I=1$, where the boundary sits at the highest $p$. The clean $p^\star$ is therefore a **conservative lower bound** on the superposition region; recovering the exact boundary means optimising the bias and scale too, which is the paper's full computation.

## 6. Take-aways: what this implies for real language models

A five-feature toy is not a language model — but it lives in the regime LLMs are believed to occupy, and that is what makes its lessons transfer.

- **LLMs live in a sparse world.** A language model must represent far more features — concepts, entities, idioms, syntactic roles, facts — than it has neurons, yet on any single token only a tiny fraction are active. That is exactly the toy model's setting: many features ($n \gg m$), each rarely on.

- **So superposition is the rule, and polysemantic neurons are efficient, not broken.** The toy model's central result is that when features are numerous and sparse, the *loss-minimizing* solution packs more features than dimensions into overlapping directions. A neuron that responds to many unrelated things is the expected, efficient outcome — not a confused model.

- **This is why interpretability is hard, and what to do about it.** If features live in overlapping directions that outnumber the neurons, then the neurons are the wrong basis to read. Understanding the model means recovering the feature *directions*, not inspecting neurons one at a time — the conceptual basis for **dictionary learning / sparse autoencoders**. The toy model is the fully-solvable justification for that program.

- **The capacity–sparsity trade-off scales.** Sparser features mean more packed per dimension, so an LLM's dense activations can be read as a *noisy simulation of a much larger, sparser network*: far more features than neurons, at the price of interference that sparsity keeps rare (a collision costs only when two features fire together, $\propto \text{density}^2$). Superposition buys capacity; the bill is interference, paid rarely.

- **Training assembles this geometry on its own.** Experiment 2B shows the feature geometry is not designed — it *emerges* as training minimizes the loss, the energy of the learned features falling to its packing minimum. The same pressure operates continuously in a real model, and is part of the picture behind why representations can reorganize in sudden steps during training.

*Caveat.* These are implications *by analogy*, not theorems about LLMs: real models have privileged bases, attention, depth, correlated and non-uniform features, and far richer dynamics than a one-layer autoencoder on synthetic data. The toy model's worth is that it makes the *mechanism* — sparsity buying superposition, and superposition forcing a feature basis distinct from the neuron basis — transparent in a setting we can solve exactly.

## 9. Appendix — the regular-polygon identities

The two closed forms used in Experiment 2. For $k$ unit vectors equally spaced on the circle, write $\hat{W}_a = (\cos\theta_a, \sin\theta_a)$ with $\theta_a = 2\pi a / k$, so that $\hat{W}_a \cdot \hat{W}_b = \cos\big(\tfrac{2\pi (a-b)}{k}\big)$. The one fact we need is that for $k \ge 3$ the cross term vanishes and

```math
\sum_{d=0}^{k-1} \cos^2 \Big(\tfrac{2\pi d}{k}\Big) = \frac{k}{2}. \quad (11)
```

**Dimensionality** $D_i = 2/k$ (Eq 5). With unit vectors $\| W_i \| = 1$, the denominator of $D_i$ is exactly the sum above, so

```math
\sum_{j} \bigl(\hat{W}_i \cdot W_j\bigr)^2 = \sum_{d=0}^{k-1} \cos^2\!\Big(\tfrac{2\pi d}{k}\Big) = \frac{k}{2} \quad\Longrightarrow\quad D_i = \frac{1}{k/2} = \frac{2}{k}. \quad (12)
```

**Frustration energy** $E_k = \tfrac14 k(k-2)$ (Eq 6). Summing over unordered pairs, with $k$ ordered pairs for each nonzero difference $d$,

```math
E_k = \sum_{a \lt b} \cos^2\!\Big(\tfrac{2\pi (a-b)}{k}\Big) = \frac{k}{2}\sum_{d=1}^{k-1}\cos^2\!\Big(\tfrac{2\pi d}{k}\Big) = \frac{k}{2}\Big(\frac{k}{2} - 1\Big) = \frac{k(k-2)}{4}. \quad (13)
```

For the pentagon $E_5 = \tfrac14 \cdot 5 \cdot 3 = 3.75$ (an antipodal pair, $k=2$, gives $E = 1$ separately).
