"""Experiment 3 — quantised geometry and the packing-problem connection.

Two ideas, one figure.

(A) Geometric phases. As we sweep sparsity for the small model (n = 5, m = 2),
    the per-feature dimensionality D_i does not vary smoothly: it locks onto a
    discrete ladder of preferred values,

        1            a feature alone on its own axis
        2/3 ≈ 0.67   three features at 120°  (a triangle)
        1/2 = 0.50   two antipodal features  (a "digon" / a pair)
        2/5 = 0.40   five features at 72°     (a pentagon)

    Each value corresponds to a specific regular arrangement of feature vectors.
    The flat plateaus separated by jumps are the signature of distinct
    geometric *phases*, just like the discrete plateaus in a physical system.

(B) A packing problem. At high sparsity the five features form a regular
    pentagon. We show that this arrangement minimises a "frustration energy"
    E = Σ_{i<j} (Ŵ_i·Ŵ_j)² — the same flavour of objective as the Thomson
    problem (point charges repelling on a sphere). The network, just by
    minimising reconstruction error, discovers the optimal packing.
